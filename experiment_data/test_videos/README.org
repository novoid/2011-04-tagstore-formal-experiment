During the experiment, a video camera recorded the room, following he
TP as they were moving from welcome table to test computer and
back. During the tasks, a screencast was recorded showing the test
persons face (built-in webcam), the screen content of the test
computer, and the (built-in) audio.

Video camera recording was started before TP entered the room, was
paused when screencast recording started, re-started after the last
tasks with «how was it», and stopped after TP left the experiment
room. No TP was in the experiment room without being recorded.

Unfortunately we do not have the permission (and storage capacity) to
publish the videos and screencasts. If you need something from the
videos, please write at Karl.Voit@IST.TUGraz.at
