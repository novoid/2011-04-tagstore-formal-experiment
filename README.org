* Formal Experiment

In January 2011, a formal experiment was conducted which aimed to
clear some questions in the field of personal information management
(PIM), information re-finding, and information architecture. In April
2011 we conducted another experiment with slightly different focus.

For this purpose, the testing framework [[http://tagstore.org][tagstore]] was used to *compare*
storing files (images, graphics and documents) within the 
*folder hierarchy* using Microsoft Windows Explorer *and tagstore*.

The tagstore framework supports file management by applying
tags. Those tags are being used to (automatically) generate *navigation
hierarchies*, called TagTrees.

This repository contains anonymous data from the experiment in order
to *check, extend, or re-evaluate the experiment*.

This is Open Data.

This is [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_research][Open Science]].

* Other Experiment Repositories

The January-experiment:

The April experiment has less technical logs, a two week pause between
filing and re-finding, more test persons, more test items, more
detailed questionnaires.

* Language

The experiment was conducted by a group of Karl Voit ([[http://www.TUGraz.az][Graz University
of Technology]]) and took place in [[http://maps.google.com/maps?f%3Dq&source%3Ds_q&hl%3Den&geocode%3D&q%3DInffeldgasse%2B16b,%2Bgraz,%2Baustria&aq%3D&sll%3D47.070714,15.439504&sspn%3D0.143575,0.308647&vpsrc%3D0&ie%3DUTF8&hq%3D&hnear%3DInffeldgasse%2B16b,%2BJakomini%2B8010%2BGraz,%2BSteiermark,%2BAustria&t%3Dh&z%3D16&iwloc%3DA][Graz, Austria]]. Therefore, the
language of the test persons was *German*. All data which test persons
were confronted with is in German. Derived data and supplementary
things such as evaluation scripts are in *English* though.

* What is missing

In near future, all relevant experiment data should be online. If
something is not online (like for example the TP videos), a README.org
explains further things or links to an alternative hosting place.

Currently, the detailed results are being extracted. The raw results
are somewhat irritating due to several things like bugs in
software. 

Here is the list of things which will be published here in future:

** Transcripts

We developed a detailed transcript language and are writing down each
event very carefully: counting mouse clicks, writing down each spoken
word, taking notes on each relevant GUI element interaction. 

This took us very long.

The definition of the transcript language will be published here
too.

The raw transcript files will be published here soon.

** Transcript processing scripts

Python-parser are reading the transcript files and generate a ASCII
and CSV summary per transcript file. Those parsers will be published
too.

** Raw and Summarized Results

The summarized CSV files (all TPs) as well as Spreadsheets containing
the derived diagrams will be published.

** Formal Experiment Report

A report containing the most important results will be published here.
